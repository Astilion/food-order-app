React project from section 12 of course: React - The Complete Guide 2023 (incl. React Router & Redux) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

This project is a simple application that allows you to order meals, with the ability to add products to your cart.

In this project, I receive CSS and graphics files from the instructor and have an overview of the final application.
I try to do the rest myself using previously learned techniques such as useState, useEffect, useReducer, useContext and more.
